# Professor Puzzle

Algorithmic solutions to puzzles made by "Professor Puzzle."

For Christmas, my wife gave me a [Square Chain Puzzle](http://professorpuzzle.com/httpdocs/04solutions/04menu.html).
I'm terrible at these kinds of puzzles, but it occurred to me as I was suffering through it that it would be amenable
to the same sort of solution as the classic challenge of enumerating all the possible tic-tac-toe games.

## Installing

Just `git pull` it -- it has no external dependencies. It requires at least node v4.

## Using

From the top level of the repo:

    node square_chain.js
